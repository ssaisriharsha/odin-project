        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>
            Veg noodles are a popular and versatile dish made by stir-frying cooked noodles with a variety of fresh vegetables and seasonings. Typically, the noodles are first boiled until al dente and then tossed in a hot wok with ingredients like bell peppers, carrots, cabbage, onions, and sometimes mushrooms. Common seasonings include soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and chili sauce, which add a rich and savory flavor to the dish.
            This meal is not only quick and easy to prepare but also highly customizable, allowing for the inclusion of various vegetables based on personal preference or seasonal availability. Veg noodles can be enjoyed as a standalone meal or paired with other dishes like tofu, spring rolls, or a light soup. They are a staple in many Asian cuisines and are loved for their delicious taste and nutritional value, making them a favorite among vegetarians and health-conscious individuals.
