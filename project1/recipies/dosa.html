                <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Dosa is a thin, crispy South Indian crepe made from a fermented batter of rice and split black lentils (urad dal). It is a staple dish in Southern India and is widely enjoyed for its delightful texture and versatility. The batter is prepared by soaking rice and lentils, blending them into a smooth paste, and fermenting overnight to develop a slightly tangy flavor.
                    To make dosa, a ladleful of batter is spread thinly and evenly on a hot griddle or skillet, creating a circular shape. It is cooked until golden brown and crispy on the edges, then folded or rolled before serving. Dosas can be enjoyed plain with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based stew), or stuffed with various fillings like spiced potatoes (masala dosa) or cheese.
                    This dish is not only a favorite for breakfast or brunch but is also cherished as a satisfying snack or part of a traditional South Indian meal. Its light, crisp texture and mild, fermented taste make it a delightful choice for anyone looking to experience authentic South Indian cuisine.
